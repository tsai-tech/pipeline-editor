# Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the **Pipeline Editor** monorepo: its
domains, library layers, the canvas data model, the backend contract, and module
boundaries.

The deliverable is a set of **publishable Angular libraries** from which an
external application assembles a visual editor for AI-agent pipelines (inspired by
[n8n](https://n8n.io)). The `playground` app exists for local development only and
is not published.

---

## 1. Goals and principles

1. **The frontend does NOT execute pipelines.** Node semantics are owned by the
   backend (the "system" that runs 24/7). The frontend is a **graph editor + data
   schema + vendor-neutral port** `PipelineBackend` (`startRun` / `observe` /
   `stop`). It draws the graph, validates its structure, and observes a run; it
   does not know what a node actually does. See
   [§6](#6-the-workflow-domain--backend-contract).
2. **Editor ↔ business separation.** The canvas (drawing, navigation, editing the
   graph) knows nothing about concrete integrations. Those are described by the
   node-type registry (`shared/nodes`) and executed by the backend.
3. **Layering.** Every library has a type: `model → util → core → ui → feature`.
   Dependencies only go "top-down"; enforced by tags and
   `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` (see [§7](#7-module-boundaries)).
4. **Presentational components in `ui`, state in `core`.** UI components are
   "dumb" (`input()/output()`, `OnPush`); state lives in signal stores in the
   `core` layer.
5. **The data model is the single source of truth.** Both the editor and the
   backend operate on one serializable pipeline model from `shared/models`.
6. **Everything through Nx.** Build, test, lint, release — only via
   `nx run/run-many/affected`.

---

## 2. Domains

| Domain       | scope tag        | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **board**    | `scope:board`    | The canvas: graph store, viewport, navigation, nodes, edges, edge routing. |
| **workflow** | `scope:workflow` | Implementations of the `PipelineBackend` port. Today: `mock` (in-browser). |
| **shared**   | `scope:shared`   | Data model, node-type registry, theme, the reusable ui-kit.                |
| **app**      | `scope:app`      | Host application(s): `playground`.                                         |

The **board** domain answers "how it looks and how you drive it with the mouse".
The **workflow** domain answers "which backend runs it". They are linked by the
serializable pipeline model and the `PipelineBackend` contract in `shared/models`.

---

## 3. Library map

```
apps/
  playground/               @scope:app  type:app         host app (nx serve → /board)

packages/                   (folder / nx name    →  npm name)
  shared/
    models/    (models)     @tsai-pe/models        scope:shared type:model  ← types + validation + backend contract
    nodes/     (nodes)      @tsai-pe/nodes         scope:shared type:model  ← node-type registry (derivePorts, catalog, schemas)
    theme/     (theme)      @tsai-pe/theme         scope:shared type:util   ← Tailwind tokens + global CSS
  ui-kit/      (ui-kit)     @tsai-pe/ui-kit        scope:shared type:ui     ← Angular Aria + CDK + Tailwind

  board/
    core/      (core)       @tsai-pe/board-core    scope:board  type:core   ← BoardStore, viewport, geometry, A* routing
    ui/        (ui)         @tsai-pe/board-ui      scope:board  type:ui     ← pe-board-grid, pe-node
    feature/   (feature)    @tsai-pe/board         scope:board  type:feature ← <pe-board> — the public editor (main package)

  workflow/                 (private — not published to npm)
    mock/      (mock)       @tsai-pe/workflow-mock scope:workflow type:core ← TestBackendSystem (mock backend, evaluates expressions)
    http/      (http)       @tsai-pe/workflow-http scope:workflow type:core ← RestWsBackend (REST + WS/SSE adapter, skeleton)
```

> The public scope is **`@tsai-pe`**; names are flat (`@scope/name`, one slash) —
> npm requires it and Angular/Vue/Nx do the same. The domain/layer hierarchy is
> encoded in the name itself (`board-core`, `board-ui`), not a nested path. The
> folders / nx project names keep the nesting.

The node-type registry lives in its own lib `shared/nodes` (not in `models`) on
purpose: it is read by both the editor and the future engine — it is data, not the
logic of any one layer.

### Dependency graph

  playground --> mock[workflow/mock]
  playground --> theme[shared/theme]

  boardFeature --> boardUi[board/ui]
  boardFeature --> boardCore[board/core]

```

Key point: **`board/*` and `workflow/*` do not depend on each other** — only via
`shared/*`. The editor can be built with no backend at all; a backend adapter can
be written and tested with no editor.

---

## 4. ui-kit and styling

### 4.1 ui-kit on Angular Aria (type:ui)

Reusable components (buttons, fields, selects, menus, dialogs, toasts, tabs…) are
built on **[Angular Aria](https://angular.dev/guide/aria/overview)** — headless
accessible directives (keyboard, focus, ARIA) **with no visual styles** — plus
`@angular/cdk` for infrastructure: **Overlay** (popovers, menus, modals),
**Portal**, **a11y** (dialog focus trap), **Virtual Scroll** (long lists). All
markup and styles are our own, via Tailwind + theme tokens.

### 4.2 Styling: Tailwind v4 (CSS-first)

We style with **Tailwind v4** without `tailwind.config.js`. The single entry and
tokens live in `@tsai-pe/theme` (`theme.css` — tokens as CSS variables; `index.css`
— `@import "tailwindcss"` + mapping tokens into `@theme` + canvas helpers).

Wiring in the app (`styles.css`):

```css
@import '@tsai-pe/theme';
@source '../../../packages/board'; /* scan classes from the libraries, incl. .ts */
@source '../../../packages/ui-kit';
```

**Styling decision (don't break):** Tailwind everywhere, **including host classes**
via `host: { class: '…' }` in the decorator — Tailwind scans `.ts` thanks to
`@source packages/board`. A component `.css` is allowed **only** for what utilities
can't express (host state, SVG); there is none of that today — the libraries have
no `.css` files. The libraries need no Tailwind build step of their own: the app's
scan picks up their classes.

### 4.3 Theme

Dark-first, "premium/technological" (Linear/Vercel × Apple glass): a single accent
— electric indigo, a neutral near-black background, hairline borders instead of
shadows. Node roles/types are coded with muted tints (a 2px rail, a port dot, an
icon); the node body stays neutral. The light theme mirrors the same tokens
(`class="light"` on `<html>`). `ui-kit` and `shared/theme` are `scope:shared`,
available to all domains, and depend on neither `board` nor `workflow`.

---

## 5. The board domain (canvas)

Visual editing of the graph. Three layers.

### 5.1 `board/core` — state and logic (type:core)

Pure TS + Angular signals, no templates:

- **`BoardStore`** — a signal document store: nodes, edges, selection, history
  (undo/redo, limit 100), clipboard (copy/paste with offset), viewport. Exposes
  read-only signals. Computes `edgeGeometries` (routing of all edges),
  `contentBounds`, live validation `issues`, `ancestorsOf(id)` (a node's ancestors
  in the DAG — the expression context). Validates connections (`canConnect`:
  output→input, no cycle, fan-in allowed).
- **`Viewport`** — pan `{x,y}` + clamped zoom, `screen ↔ world`, `zoomAround`
  (zoom around the cursor), `fitTo`.
- **`geometry`** — the grid (32-px cell), `nodeRect`, `portAnchor` (ports
  distributed by side fraction), rectangle intersection, bezier edge path.
- **`routing`** — orthogonal edge routing on the 16-unit subgrid via **A\***:
  avoids nodes (inflated), softly repels already-routed edges, penalizes turns;
  falls back to a bezier when no path is found.

Depends on: `shared/models`, `shared/nodes`.

### 5.2 `board/ui` — presentational components (type:ui)

"Dumb" `OnPush` components (prefix `pe`):

- **`pe-board-grid`** — the dot-grid background, reacts to the viewport.
- **`pe-node`** — a node's visuals: ports by side fraction, control-flow branch
  labels, run status/progress overlays.

Depends on: `board/core`, `shared/models`, `shared/nodes`.

### 5.3 `board/feature` — the assembled editor (type:feature) · public entry point

The `<pe-board>` component: wires `BoardStore` to the `board/ui` components,
handles keyboard/mouse (pan/zoom with right/middle/Space, marquee selection,
drag-and-drop from the catalog palette, copy/paste, undo/redo, hotkeys, resize,
context menu, alignment guides, delete-safety), draws the minimap and the
inspector (params from the catalog + Run data), the issues panel and the run log.
It injects the backend via the `PIPELINE_BACKEND` token and observes the run.
Modals/buttons come from `ui-kit`.

Depends on: `board/core`, `board/ui`, `ui-kit`, `shared/models`, `shared/nodes`.

---

## 6. The workflow domain + backend contract

The frontend contains no execution. It talks to the backend through the
vendor-neutral `PipelineBackend` port (in `shared/models/backend.ts`):

```ts
interface PipelineBackend {
  startRun(pipeline: Pipeline): string; // submit a run → runId
  observe(runId: string, listener: RunListener): Unsubscribe; // subscribe; the
  // listener fires immediately
  // with the current state
  stop(runId: string): void; // request cancellation
}
```

The backend pushes immutable `RunSnapshot`s to observers on every change:
`{ runId, status, nodes: Record<id, NodeRun>, log: RunLogEntry[] }`, where `NodeRun`
carries `status` (idle/running/success/error), optional `error`, `output`, and
`progress: { done, total }` (for split/merge). The contract is **framework-free**
(callbacks, no Signal/Observable) so it can live in `shared` next to the model.

### `workflow/mock` — `TestBackendSystem` (type:core)

An in-browser mock of the "system" that implements `PipelineBackend`. It walks the
graph cooperatively (via `setTimeout`, cancelable) in topological order (Kahn; a
cycle → run rejected) and emits snapshots as nodes transition
idle → running → success/error/skipped. It models:

- **real expressions** — triggers are fake (they push a shape from the catalog
  immediately), but the mock **evaluates** the expression language (`expression.ts`,
  no `eval`): `$json` / `$node["Title"]`, path access, operators, `{{ }}` templates.
  So control-flow (if/switch/filter) really routes, Set Fields extracts a field
  from context, and effects resolve their params. Reading into a changed shape (a
  missing path) **throws** → the node fails (as in n8n) — fatal, except for an
  optional effect; the error is highlighted on the node and in the inspector. This
  exercises the language itself;
- **one firing trigger per run** — a pipeline may have several triggers, but an
  event enters from one channel: the mock picks one (round-robin per Run click, or
  explicitly), the rest are `skipped`, so routing "by trigger" is meaningful;
- **control-flow** — only the "taken" branch runs; nodes behind an untaken branch
  are `skipped`;
- **`split → merge` fan-out** — `split ×N` fans the stream out (each node between
  split and merge runs N times, progress n/n, "×N" in the log), `merge` collapses
  back to 1;
- **errors** — fatal ones fail the run; an optional `effect` (`required: false`,
  e.g. a logger) does not.

A real REST/WS adapter is just another implementation of the same port; the editor
can't tell them apart. It is injected into `<pe-board>` via `PIPELINE_BACKEND`.

### Persistence — the `PipelineStore` port

A port separate from running (`shared/models/store.ts`): `save` / `load` / `list` /
`remove` pipelines + `runHistory`. It is **async** (Promise-based) — persistence is
inherently remote (unlike the sync run port). `InMemoryPipelineStore`
(`workflow/mock`) is an in-browser implementation: it deep-clones documents on the
way in and out, so stored state can't be mutated by reference. A real REST store is
another implementation of the same port.

### `workflow/http` — `RestWsBackend` (type:core)

A skeleton of a real port implementation: commands over **REST** (`POST /runs`,
`POST /runs/{id}/stop`), run snapshots over a stream (**WebSocket**/SSE). It proves
the contract against a real transport. The transport (`fetch` + a socket factory)
is injected — the lib stays headless and unit-testable without a network.

**A seam found (sync/async).** The port's `startRun` returns an id **synchronously**,
while REST assigns one **asynchronously**. The solution: the adapter returns a
**local** id up front, POSTs in the background, and once it has the server id opens
the stream and **relabels** server snapshots onto the local id. The caller only
sees the local id and never the reconciliation. This is a signal for future
"contract maturity": `startRun` may want to become async.

---

## 7. Module boundaries

Defined in `eslint.config.mjs` (`@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`), checked by lint.
An import is allowed only if it satisfies **both** the scope and the type
constraints.

### Scope (which domain sees which)

| sourceTag        | may depend on                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scope:shared`   | `scope:shared`                                               |
| `scope:board`    | `scope:board`, `scope:shared`                                |
| `scope:workflow` | `scope:workflow`, `scope:shared`                             |
| `scope:app`      | `scope:app`, `scope:board`, `scope:workflow`, `scope:shared` |

### Type (layering)

| sourceTag      | may depend on                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `type:app`     | `feature`, `ui`, `core`, `util`, `model` |
| `type:feature` | `feature`, `ui`, `core`, `util`, `model` |
| `type:ui`      | `ui`, `core`, `util`, `model`            |
| `type:core`    | `core`, `util`, `model`                  |
| `type:util`    | `util`                                   |
| `type:model`   | `model`                                  |

`shared/nodes` is tagged `type:model`: it depends only on `shared/models`
(`model → model`), and every consumer (`core`/`ui`/`feature`/`app`) is allowed to
pull `type:model`. So `ui-kit` (`type:ui`) technically could depend on `type:core`,
but the scope rule won't let it pull `board/core` (`scope:board`) — both
constraints must hold at once.

---

## 8. Data model

A single serializable model in `shared/models` — the editor ↔ backend contract.

```ts
// grid-based coordinates (in cells of the 32-grid)
type NodeKind = 'trigger' | 'action' | 'effect';
type ActionCategory = 'control-flow' | 'transform' | 'integration' | 'split' | 'merge';

interface NodePort {
  id: string;
  role: 'input' | 'output';
  side: 'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom';
  label?: string; // e.g. a control-flow branch name ("true"/"false")
}

interface BoardNode {
  id: string;
  kind: NodeKind;
  category?: ActionCategory; // for kind === 'action'
  type?: string; // a concrete catalog type (e.g. 'llm-agent')
  title: string;
  pos: GridPos; // { col, row } — cells
  size: CellSize; // { cols, rows }
  ports: NodePort[]; // derived by the registry from kind/config
  config?: NodeConfig; // control-flow only (if/switch/filter)
  data?: Record<string, unknown>; // node parameter values
  status?: NodeStatus; // run overlay
}

interface Edge {
  // output port → input port
  id: string;
  source: { nodeId: string; portId: string }; // output
  target: { nodeId: string; portId: string }; // input
}

interface Pipeline {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  nodes: BoardNode[];
  edges: Edge[];
}
```

**Fan-in is allowed.** An input accepts **multiple** incoming connections (OR /
run-on-arrival semantics): distinct sources — e.g. several telegram/whatsapp/slack
triggers — converge on one node that fires when any of them delivers. This is a
union of sources, and it is orthogonal to `split`/`merge`, which are about the
cardinality of **one** stream (`split` hands out array elements, `merge` buffers N
events into an `Array[N]`), not about joining different ones. Validation
(`validatePipeline` in `models`): the graph is a DAG (no cycles), a connection runs
`output → input`, disconnected nodes are a warning. `connect` never creates a
duplicate of the same connection.

### Node-type registry — `shared/nodes`

The registry (n8n-style) is read by both the editor and the future engine:

- **control-flow** (`if`/`switch`/`filter`) — a fixed set with its own form; output
  ports are **derived from config** (`derivePorts` / `controlFlowOutputs`),
  `defaultControlFlowConfig` gives the starting configuration.
- **trigger / integration / effect** — **open-ended**: each concrete `node.type`
  from `NODE_CATALOG` has its own parameter schema (`ParamField[]`, `paramSchema`),
  values live in `node.data`. The catalog here is a seed; a real backend supplies
  its own.

---

## 9. Playground

`apps/playground` (`scope:app`, `type:app`) is a minimal app for local development
and e2e (Playwright). It mounts `<pe-board>` on the `/board` route and injects
`TestBackendSystem` via `PIPELINE_BACKEND`. Not published.

---

## 10. Tests, build, and release

- **Tests — Vitest.** Each tested lib has a `vitest.config.mts` and an inferred
  `vite:test` target (`@nx/vite/plugin`), `node` environment. The pure layers are
  covered: `models` (validation/helpers), `nodes` (registry), `core`
  (geometry/viewport/routing/BoardStore), `mock` (`TestBackendSystem`). The Angular
  libs (`board`, `board-ui`, `ui-kit`) use `@nx/angular:unit-test` (`test` target).
- **Libraries are buildable** (`@nx/js:tsc` / Angular build), lint via ESLint.
- Each lib's public API is only via `src/index.ts` (barrel), no "deep" imports
  between packages.
- Release via `nx release` (independent versions, conventional commits).

```bash
npx nx serve playground              # demo editor at /board
npx nx run-many -t test vite:test    # unit tests
npx nx affected -t lint test build   # only what changed (CI)
npx nx run-many -t build             # build all libraries
```

---

## 11. Generating libraries

Libraries are created with Nx generators and the correct tags (via the
`nx-generate` skill; exact flags there). For reference:

```bash
# shared (headless — @nx/js)
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/shared/models --tags=scope:shared,type:model
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/shared/nodes  --tags=scope:shared,type:model
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/shared/theme  --tags=scope:shared,type:util

# ui-kit + board/ui/feature (Angular; ui-kit on @angular/aria + @angular/cdk)
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib packages/ui-kit         --tags=scope:shared,type:ui
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib packages/board/ui       --tags=scope:board,type:ui
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib packages/board/feature  --tags=scope:board,type:feature

# board/core — framework-light (signals only), headless @nx/js
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/board/core --tags=scope:board,type:core

# workflow (headless — @nx/js)
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/workflow/mock --tags=scope:workflow,type:core

# playground
npx nx g @nx/angular:app apps/playground --tags=scope:app,type:app
```

> After generating, check the tags in `project.json` and the boundaries:
> `npx nx graph`.
